# Welcome to Flexible tabs!

Have you ever wanted to have a simple way of creating robust tabs in your application? Have you thought of what it takes to get there? With flexible tabs, you can configure position of tabs and how they should be displayed.  You can feed icons to the tabs and have a view area for displaying images. You can have the view area to be rendered only if selected and watch for tab selection events to perform additional tasks. And most of all, you can have contents of each tab dynamically loaded!!

**NOTE:** Starting with version 1.1.0 this library is compatible with Angular 6+.

**NOTE:** Starting with version 1.2.1 you need to import this library through @sedeh/flexible-tabs.
